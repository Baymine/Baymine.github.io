# About Me

Hi, I'm **York Cao**, a passionate Data Engineer based in Beijing. Welcome to my personal blog where I share my thoughts on technology, programming, and life.

## What I Do

### 💼 Professional Focus
- **Data Engineering**: Building robust data pipelines and infrastructure
- **Software Development**: Creating efficient and scalable solutions
- **Technology Research**: Exploring new technologies and sharing insights
- **System Architecture**: Designing high-performance distributed systems

### 🔧 Technical Expertise
```bash
# Core Technologies
$ cat /etc/skills/core.txt
- ClickHouse (Database Engine)
- C++ (System Programming)
- Python (Data Processing)
- SQL (Query Optimization)
- Linux (System Administration)
```

## Research Interests

I'm particularly passionate about:

| Area | Focus | Current Projects |
|------|-------|------------------|
| **Database Systems** | Query optimization, storage engines | ClickHouse source analysis |
| **Operating Systems** | Kernel internals, memory management | MIT 6.S081 coursework |
| **Distributed Systems** | Consensus algorithms, fault tolerance | Research papers review |
| **Computer Networks** | Protocol analysis, performance tuning | Network optimization |

## Recent Learning Journey

### 📚 Current Studies
- **ClickHouse Internals**: Deep diving into the columnar database architecture
- **MIT 6.S081**: Operating system engineering and kernel development
- **C++ Advanced Topics**: Memory management, concurrency, and optimization
- **Network Protocols**: TCP/IP stack analysis and performance optimization

### 🎯 2024 Goals
- [ ] Complete ClickHouse source code analysis series
- [ ] Finish MIT 6.S081 labs and write detailed notes
- [ ] Contribute to open source database projects
- [ ] Publish research on query optimization techniques

## Technical Philosophy

> "The best way to understand a system is to build it from scratch,
> and the second best way is to read its source code."

I believe in:
- **Deep Understanding**: Going beyond surface-level knowledge
- **Practical Application**: Learning through hands-on implementation
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Contributing to the developer community
- **Continuous Learning**: Staying curious about emerging technologies
